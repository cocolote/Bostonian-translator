##Boston-translator

This program handle a big list of bostonians words. I try to find a logic pattern
to the accent but there isn't so I decided to create a huge list with the most
common words :) Hope you like it.

I don't know if this is cheating but I'm already in the program :) thank to all
that we learned in this five weeks I was able to use ajax, ruby, javascript and
sinatra to build this little translator. I had fun developing it so hope you like
it.
